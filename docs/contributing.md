# Contributing to DDPS

Thanks for your interest in contribute to DDPS. Here's a brief overview on how best to do so.

## Support request?

If you are having trouble setting up or running DDPS, then currently the best place to get help is by sending an email to [ddps@deic.dk](mailto:ddps@deic.dk)

Posting your problem there ensures more people will see it and you should get support faster than creating a new issue on GitHub. Please do create a new issue on GitHub if you think you've found a bug though! 

## What to change

Here's some examples of things you might want to make a pull request for:

  - New features
  - Bugfixes
  - Inefficient blocks of code

If you have a more deeply-rooted problem with how the program is built or some of the stylistic decisions made in the code, it's best to [create an issue](https://github.com/ddps/ddps-documentation/issues/new) before putting the effort into a pull request. The same goes for new features - it might be best to check the project's direction, existing pull requests, and currently open and closed issues first.

## Style

Look at existing code to get a good feel for the patterns we use.

  - please use tabs not space
  - No editor-specific cruft in source code or `.gitignore`

## Using Git appropriately

  1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/ddps/ddps-documentation/fork_select) to your GitHub account
  1. Create a *topical branch* - a branch whose name is succinct but explains what you're doing, such as `feature/storm-etl`
  1. Make your changes, committing at logical breaks
  1. Push your branch to your personal account
  1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
  1. Watch for comments or acceptance

Please note - if you want to change multiple things that don't depend on each other, make sure you check the master branch back out before making more changes - that way we can take in each change separately.
